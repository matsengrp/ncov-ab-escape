# NCoV-AB-Escape Project

Welcome to the ncov-ab-escape repository. This project focuses on analyzing the escape mechanisms of the novel coronavirus (NCoV) against antibody (AB) Responses. Here, you'll find notebooks containing our research, data analyses, and final results.

## Repository Structure

- **Root Directory**: Contains all the initial, original Jupyter notebooks that were used in the early stages of our analysis. These notebooks provide a foundational understanding or patterns as to how our methods for analyzing evolved.

- **Complete Clustering Folder**: This directory holds the culmination of our research effortsâ€”the final clustering results. Within this, you'll find detailed analyses and visualizations that highlight our key findings.

- **Results**: Contains resultsing dataframes that are generated and used by the notebooks. 

### Key File

- **CompleteClustering Notebook**: Located within the Complete Clustering folder, this Jupyter notebook contains the finalized results of our project. It is the most critical piece for understanding our conclusions regarding NCoV's antibody escape mechanisms.

## Running the Notebooks

To replicate our results, you might want to run the CompleteClustering notebook from start to finish. Please note that some of the code blocks within the notebooks are commented out. To ensure the notebook executes correctly and regenerates the datasets as intended, you'll need to:

1. Uncomment all the commented code blocks as directed in the notebook.
2. Run the notebook sequentially from top to bottom.

This process will allow you to generate the datasets and results identical to our final findings.

Side note: When running any notebook, run it from top to bottom, and if you run another notebook in parallel, youll need to re-run the notebook again to get the original results, as some results can be overwritten by another notebook.
